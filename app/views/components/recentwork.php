					<h5><a href="/work/xenonmarketing/"> Xenon Marketing</a></h5>
					<p><p>Xenon Marketing is a great event and experiential marketing company in the DFW area. Theyâ€™ve helped market events all over the U.S. for large and small companies. Their website is designed well and is functioning well enough for what the company needs but they have found themselves running into some big SEO snags. After contacting many larger SEO companies they decided to give me a call to see what this little freelance operation had to offer. After going over the site I sat down with President Ed Zambie to discuss what I thought he needed and what I could do to help. </p> <a href="/work/xenonmarketing/">check-out more &raquo;</a></p>
