I recently had to do some work replacing some jQuery code with data binding Knockout code. When you are developing and app, using jQuery to do some simple interactions can be a quick and easy way to accomplish these tasks. Once your app gets big enough though you'll need something better. Knockout is a simple and light weight framework for binding data and works really well.

Here is the sample I made in [this Pen](http://codepen.io/adamaoc/details/zxVOdj/).
