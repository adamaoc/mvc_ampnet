This is the 6th major version of the txGarage website in its 8-years of existence. Version 5 of the website lived way beyond its usefulness but served its purpose nonetheless. In version 6 we finally have a fully responsive site that was built on a mobile first design. We've also integrated a lot of little features and new design elements that we've been wanting to incorporate but just were not able to because of limitations of the previous design.

The core of V6 was changed as well. We still use WordPress for the basic backend of the site but now use Timber, a cool tool for making WordPress development easier. It's also now easier to make small tweaks throughout the code and add new features as we go. We're extremely excited about the direction of the site and the opportunity that we have for future development.
