txGarage is an online, automotive magazine that features news and reviews and is focused on a Texas audience. This site needed to be able to scale well and has gone through 3 redesigns in the 5 years as clients with ampnet(media). We built this site using the WordPress framework giving them a clean and vibrant custom theme that really shows off their skills of reviewing and photographing automobiles. They are also deeply integrated into many social networks to help draw traffic.

This site is built using `WordPress` and features custom posts and custom api content.
