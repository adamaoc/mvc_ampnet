Here is a great website built for the football team at North Forney High School. The team, known as Goons, is helping to change the culture of the town with many in the town referring to it as Goonville, TX. 

The purpose of this website is to show off the schedule of the football team and help promote things that the football team is doing - like a radio show and other activities. It also has sections for player rosters and coach rosters.

### Managing the website

<div style="display:flex; align-items:center">
<img src="/assets/img/works/goonville/goonville-admin-screenshot-2.png" alt="goonville tx website admin screenshot" width="350px" />
<img src="/assets/img/works/goonville/goonville-admin-screenshot-1.png" alt="goonville tx website admin screenshot" width="350px" />
</div>

Due to security concerns and ease of use, we built the Goonville website using our own framework. This framework provides an admin area that let's admin users update content, add sponsors, update game data, update players and coaches data, and so much more. This is a very secure framework and uses some great new technologies including Facebook's React.js.

This is an ongoing project with ampnetmedia but if you're interested in learning more about the framework or getting help with your team's website, please send us a message from our [contact page](http://ampnetmedia.com/contact/).
