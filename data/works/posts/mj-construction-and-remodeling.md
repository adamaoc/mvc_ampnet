M&J is a local Dallas, Texas Construction and Remodeling company. They didn't have much direction for their site as this is their first presence online; their biggest concern was having easily viewable images to show off their work to perspective clients. This site was built using a custom built PHP framework utilizing FlexHub. The site is fully responsive starting at mobile first and going out to desktop so the client can easily show off photos from his phone or tablet. We're also utilizing technologies like Grunt for compiling Sass and JavaScript, Foundation5 as a base front-end framework, GitHub for version control and deployment. 

This was a really fun site to design and develop and the guys at M&J were great to work with. If you have any other questions please shoot me an email [here](http://ampnetmedia.com/contact/).
