I've been playing with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html), from Facebook, for a few weeks now and am really getting the hang of how these components and elements fit in together. One of my goals was to build more, as a learning process. In that vein, I decided to take Pens from CodePen that I liked and rewrite them using Reactjs. 

Here is an accordion I modeled from [this Pen](http://codepen.io/trevorlang/pen/EaKYjN ), converting it to use Reactjs.
