It’s that time of the year and Merle Norman Cosmetics & Boutique of Forney was looking for a promotional video to emphasize their mission and show off some products for the holidays. Adam first had a meeting with Tina, owner of Merle Norman Cosmetics & Boutique of Forney to go over the details of the project and get together a script and a shot-list. After coming to a decision on what we were going to shoot, we scheduled a date to film.

The day of filming went quite well as I think the end results speak for themselves. Tina was happy with the end product and shared it on Merle Norman Cosmetics & Boutique of Forney’s Facebook page becoming one of the top viewed videos published there.
